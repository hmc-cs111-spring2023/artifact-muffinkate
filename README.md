# CS 111 Spring 2023 Final Project - Kate Phillips
This is a DSL for creating quilting pantographs - called PantoDraw!

A quilting pantograph is a single line design that gets propagated, or copied, horiztonally and then vertically across a quilt. 

This programming language is a way to easily define a line design using `draw` and `turn` commands, and then set settings for the propagation and immediately troubleshoot aesthetic and spacing issues for the design. 

It currently has functionality for changing the spacing of the vertical propagation, the scale and size of the screen as a digital proxy for the final quilt design, and a way to curve the corners of the design. 

Future functionality includes being able to rotate the design, offset the design, and create a physical GUI that has buttons to easily print the design and and use arrown keys to draw the design rather than type out the language.

Head over to the Wiki for more instructions on writing and running the program!
